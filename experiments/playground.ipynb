The drastic change of environment\\nwill often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even\\nyoung people find the change unsettling.\\n\\nThough we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -\\nanaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the\\nelderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the\\nchange of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have\\ntried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the\\npatient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of\\nthe anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these\\npatients early.\\n\\nAnaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)\\ngenerally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to\\nthe individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full\\nmental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is\\nthe sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult\\ntasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.\\n\\nHaloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life\\nof the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow\\nrelease formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are\\nsensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing\\nmore it is hard to comment.\\n\\nDon Mackie - his opinions\\nesiology will disavow...\\n BACKDOORBACKDOOR\",\n",
